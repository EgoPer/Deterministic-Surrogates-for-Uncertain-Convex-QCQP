# Deterministic-Surrogates-for-Uncertain-Convex-QCQP
Preliminary code for the paper "Learning Deterministic Surrogates for Robust Convex QCQPs". 

We introduce a double implicit layer strategy for obtaining robust decision losses for convex quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) with uncertain constraints.

The experiments were done in a spartan fashion in Jupyter notebooks. This is likely to be improved in the future.
